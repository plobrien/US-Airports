# US Airports
https://plobrien.github.io/US-Airports/


The goal of this lab exercise was to create a web map of all of the airports in the United States. The airplane icon represents airports, and the color of the icon specifies whether or not the airport has a control tower. The color of the state also refers to how many airports there are in that state. States with more airports have a darker color than those with less airports.
