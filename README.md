# US Airports

https://plobrien.github.io/US-Airports/


The goal of this lab exercise was to create a web map of all of the airports in the United States. The airplane icon represents airports, and the color of the icon specifies whether or not the airport has a control tower. The orange plane icons depict the airports with control towers, while the green icons depict airports that don't have control towers. All the plane icons are interactive and show the airport name when clicked. The color of the state also refers to how many airports there are in that state. States with more airports have a darker color than those with less airports. The map has an Albers Conic Equal Area projection, SR-ORG:6630, and features dynamic labels for the states, a legend, and graticules. The projection is also used by the National Land Cover Database.
